# Usage: ./build.sh <DEVICE>

DEVICE="$1"

# Tell the environment not to use NINJA
	export USE_NINJA=false

# Delete the JACK server located in /home/<USER>/.jack*
#	rm -rf ~/.jack*

# Resize the JACK Heap size
#	export ANDROID_JACK_VM_ARGS="-Xmx4g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+TieredCompilation"

# Restart the JACK server
#	./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin kill-server
#	./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin start-server
#
# Optionally, you may want to clear CCACHE if you still have issues
        export USE_CCACHE=1
        export CCACHE_EXEC=/usr/bin/ccache
        ccache -M 50G

# Make a clean build, building dirty after you have had jack issues may result in a failed build
#	make clean

# Fix java out of memory
export _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx5g

# Compile the build
